Privacy Policy – RbxPresence Monitor
Last updated: 2025-10-13

RbxPresence Monitor (“the Extension”) is a Chrome Extension developed by an independent developer.  
The Extension allows users to monitor the online status of a specified Roblox user and receive status updates through a Discord webhook.

Information We Collect
-----------------------
• User Input Data – You enter a Roblox User ID and a Discord Webhook URL.  
 These values are stored locally in your browser storage (chrome.storage.sync) and are not sent to any third-party service except the webhook URL you provide.  
• Server Requests – When you start monitoring, the Extension sends a request to our API hosted on Render to check the Roblox Presence API and relay notifications to your webhook.

Data Retention
---------------
• No user data is permanently stored on our servers.  
• Temporary logs (for error diagnostics) may include your Roblox User ID and timestamp, and are automatically deleted within 24 hours.

Third-Party Services
--------------------
• Roblox Presence API – Used to fetch user status.  
• Discord Webhook API – Used to send notifications.  
These services operate under their own privacy policies.

Your Rights
------------
You can clear all saved data by removing the extension or clearing Chrome storage.  
No personally identifiable information is collected or shared.
